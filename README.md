# Hello Node

[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/about/) is a popular runtime that lets you run JavaScript on the server instead of in a browser. This project uses the [Fastify](https://www.fastify.io/) framework to explore basic templating with [Handlebars](https://handlebarsjs.com/) and submitting data using forms and querystrings.

## What's in this project?

‚Üê `README.md`: That‚Äôs this file, where you can tell people what your cool website does and how you built it.

‚Üê `public/style.css`: The styling rules for your pages and posts.

‚Üê `server.js`: The main server script for your new site.

‚Üê `src/`: This folder holds the main template for your site along with some basic data files.

### Working in the `src/` folder üìÅ

‚Üê `src/pages/index.hbs`: This is the main page template for your site.

‚Üê `src/colors.json`: A collection of CSS color names. We use this to pick a random color, and to match searches against color names.

‚Üê `src/seo.json`: When you're ready to share your new site or add a custom domain, change SEO/meta settings in here.
